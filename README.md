# CET140_Assignment_source_code
 Source code for the CET140 first-year specialist project. This is a classification model to hopefully allow for the detection of PD patients by their fMRI and rs-eeg measurements

The solution takes *.nii (NIFTI) images as the input for the fMRI and *.bdf as the input type for the EEG data
These should be as such relative to the source directory
